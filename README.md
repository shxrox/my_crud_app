# My CRUD App - Spring Boot & MySQL

This is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with **Spring Boot** and **MySQL**. It allows users to manage a list of items by adding, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching. The app uses **Spring Boot** for the backend, **Thymeleaf** for rendering HTML views, and **MySQL** for storing data. To run the app, clone the repository, set up a MySQL database, configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file, and run the application using Maven.
